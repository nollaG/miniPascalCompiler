This is my Compiler Project,I build it using JavaCC.

The Programming Language is a portion of Pascal.
You can just run the jar file or compile by your self.
The jar file is tested in jdk7(x86_64).

The test source code and generated assembly code is in testpas.

The Assembler is fasm(http://flatassembler.net/)
